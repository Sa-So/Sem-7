# Security
## Need ?
- to pass exam.
## Y is it Hard ?
- bcoz you haven't studied it yet.
<!-- --- -->
# Ok now serious.
<!-- --- -->
## Goals ?
### Confidentiality
### Integrity
### Availability

## Vulnerability ?
- a weakness/flaw in system that can be exploited
## Threat 
- an event that can exploit a vulnerability to negatively affect the system 
## Attack 
An attempt to spy or destroy computer systems or their associated information.
<!-- - The threats use a variety of tools, scripts, and programs to launch attacks against networks and network devices  -->
## Control
- put measures in place to manage the identified threats/vulnerabilities.
# MCQs
<!-- - Ethics = set of rules for socially acceptable behaviour -->
- techniques used to prevent virus infection : IDS, Firewall, Patching program
- Monitoring and logging tools are used for maintenance of a secure infrastructure
- InfoSec is the practice that must be taken to protect valuable information from unauthorised destruction.
- S/MIME : **Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions**
- The Kerberos protocol has Ticket granting server
- **Pattern Matching** A process used by Intrusion Detection System that involves checking for a pattern to identify unauthorized activity.
<!-- - Cyber Attack is an attempt to spy or destroy computer systems or their associated information. -->
<!-- - The aim of authentication is to determine who the user is -->
- The Repeated act of harassment or threatening behaviour is called as Cyber Stalking
- DoS attack floods systems, servers, or networks with traffic
- The illegal transmission of data from inside an organization to an external location is called as Data leakage
- Email Bombing is a type of attack in which virus are sent in email
- Digital signature provides us a way to associate the message with the sender and is the equivalent of a normal signature.
- Which of the following is not a type of hackers - green hat
- In Logic Bombs the malicious action is triggered by some specific condition
- The digital signature is created by encrypting the data with the private key of the sender
- If a person finds out a way to process milk so that there is v.little fat in any cheese made from it then it comes under Patent
- Essential steps of log management - Log Search
- Vulnerability management is the practice of identifying vulnerabilities , mitigating vulnerabilities
## 3
- One malicious node behaves like multiple nodes, this type of attack is known as Sybil attack
- An example of Selective forwarding attack is: Sinkhole attack
- The technique in which the subverted node arbitrarily neglecting to route some messages is called Neglect and Greed
- Attacks that do not target all the nodes in the network (actually these do not need because of the communication flow) but only those nodes whose are close to the base station - **Sinkhole**
- faulty entity can generate multiple identities in order to gain illegal access into the network 
- The attack where sybil nodes can accuse legitimate nodes of misbehaving - **Misbehaviour Detection**
- Sybil attack types : 
  - Voting
  - Distributed Storage
- In **Blackhole** attack, a malicious node falsely advertises good paths to the destination node during the path-finding process
- Wormhole Attack receives packets at one location in the network
- Which of the following is not a primary goal of Standard security goals - Data freshness (not auth)
- **Data Freshness** ensures the data is recent, and it ensures that no old messages have been replayed
- attacks that are launched to steal valuable information in the targeted networks - **passive**
- The attack that aims to drain off limited resources in the mobile ad hoc nodes (e.g. the battery powers), by constantly makes them busy processing unnecessary packets **Sleep Deprivation**
- Adversaries might interrupt the normal operations in the packet forwarding process by flooding the targeted destination nodes with huge unnecessary packets. **flooding attack**
- the process of guaranteeing the identity of the messenger **integrity** ![doubt](https://www.google.com)
- authorization is the process that uses bonafide credential to be issued by the appropriate authority which will be mandatory to assign access rights to users, at different levels.
- **Fabrication** Attacks performed by generating false routing information
- Repudiation refers to the - attempted denial by a node involved in a communication
- misuse based detection system - The type of detection that attack signatures with current system activities 
- Military with no existing infrastructure - MANET
- Anamoly based IDS detects intrusions as anomalies, i.e. deviations from the normal behavior patterns
- Which of the following is the Security protocol for the e-mail system is **PGP**
- Child pornography An act of possessing image or video of a minor engaged in wrong conduct. 
- For injecting executable malicious code like virus or Trojan horse for web application hacking which language is used? **JavaScript**
- Software piracy is an illegal reproduction and distribution for personal use or business. It comes under crime related to IPR infringement
- Firewalls block udp traffic
# nptel
- receiver creates hash tag to check integrity
- session symmetric key is used b/w 2 parties only once
- Dig. Signature provides
  - auth
  - non- repudiation
- Deffie Hellman key exchange protocol , if 2 parties are not auth then 
  - MITM attack can harm 
- goal of key dist centre is to reduce risk in exchanging keys 
- when prime p is used in ElGamal sign & composite n used in RSA
  - RSA sign is faster than elgamal
