# Security
## Need ?
- to pass exam.
## Y is it Hard ?
- bcoz you haven't studied it yet.
<!-- --- -->
# Ok now serious.
<!-- --- -->
## Goals ?
### Confidentiality
### Integrity
### Availability

## Vulnerability ?
- a weakness/flaw in system that can be exploited
## Threat 
- an event that can exploit a vulnerability to negatively affect the system 
## Attack 
An attempt to spy or destroy computer systems or their associated information.
<!-- - The threats use a variety of tools, scripts, and programs to launch attacks against networks and network devices  -->
## Control
- put measures in place to manage the identified threats/vulnerabilities.

## 3
- One malicious node behaves like multiple nodes, this type of attack is known as Sybil attack
- An example of Selective forwarding attack is: Sinkhole attack
- The technique in which the subverted node arbitrarily neglecting to route some messages is called Neglect and Greed
- Attacks that do not target all the nodes in the network (actually these do not need because of the communication flow) but only those nodes whose are close to the base station - **Sinkhole**
- faulty entity can generate multiple identities in order to gain illegal access into the network 
- The attack where sybil nodes can accuse legitimate nodes of misbehaving - **Misbehaviour Detection**
- Sybil attack types : 
  - Voting
  - Distributed Storage
- In **Blackhole** attack, a malicious node falsely advertises good paths to the destination node during the path-finding process
- Wormhole Attack receives packets at one location in the network
- Which of the following is not a primary goal of Standard security goals - Data freshness (not auth)
- **Data Freshness** ensures the data is recent, and it ensures that no old messages have been replayed
- attacks that are launched to steal valuable information in the targeted networks - **passive**
- The attack that aims to drain off limited resources in the mobile ad hoc nodes (e.g. the battery powers), by constantly makes them busy processing unnecessary packets **Sleep Deprivation**
- Adversaries might interrupt the normal operations in the packet forwarding process by flooding the targeted destination nodes with huge unnecessary packets. **flooding attack**
- the process of guaranteeing the identity of the messenger **integrity** ![doubt](https://www.google.com)
- authorization is the process that uses bonafide credential to be issued by the appropriate authority which will be mandatory to assign access rights to users, at different levels.
- **Fabrication** Attacks performed by generating false routing information
- Repudiation refers to the - attempted denial by a node involved in a communication
- misuse based detection system - The type of detection that attack signatures with current system activities 
- Military with no existing infrastructure - MANET
- Anamoly based IDS detects intrusions as anomalies, i.e. deviations from the normal behavior patterns
- Which of the following is the Security protocol for the e-mail system is **PGP**
- Child pornography An act of possessing image or video of a minor engaged in wrong conduct. 
- For injecting executable malicious code like virus or Trojan horse for web application hacking which language is used? **JavaScript**
- Software piracy is an illegal reproduction and distribution for personal use or business. It comes under crime related to IPR infringement
- Firewalls block udp traffic
# nptel
- receiver creates hash tag to check integrity
- session symmetric key is used b/w 2 parties only once
- Dig. Signature provides
  - auth
  - non- repudiation
- Deffie Hellman key exchange protocol , if 2 parties are not auth then 
  - MITM attack can harm 
- goal of key dist centre is to reduce risk in exchanging keys 
- when prime p is used in ElGamal sign & composite n used in RSA
  - RSA sign is faster than elgamal
# Prev Year
- Vernam Cipher 
  - PT : RAMSWARUPK , Key : RANCHOBABA
  - CT : **IAZUDOSUQK**
- Shuffling letters = transposition ciphers
- SUN , Ceaser Cipher , key = 2
  - **UWP**
- if system is not tested in scanning and gaining access phase malicious hacker can access
- hacking is useful :
  - Recover lost info.
  - perform pen testing to strengthen Net. Sec
  - put predicitive measures 
- Key Table = 5x5 grid of alpha => **PlayFair Cipher**
- Matrix operations
  - Hill 
  - PlayFair
- employee training is not an example of physical sec
- Data Reduncdancy is not a primary obj of cryptography (CIA is)
- Ceaser Cipher key can be ann alpha
- Stream Cipher the plain-text is processed 1-bit at a time & a series of actions is carried out on it for generating one bit of cipher-text.

- **One-time pad** has piece of keyword that has the same length as that of the plaintext
- Block Cipher : PlayFair
- Trojan is not a type  of virus , (Polymorphic Boot Sector Functional are)

- **IPSec** defines **AH & ESP** protocols
- **botnet** network of compromised devices
- **DoS**
  - Vulnerability 
  - Bandwidth flooding
  - Connection flooding 
- WN is Infra less
- Sensor nodes used in WSN monitors the environment in a particular area with the help of **onboard processor** 
- **evaluation software** processes data received by WLAN access point
- **radio node** is used to receive data produced by sensors and sends it to wlan access point 
- **WSN** mainly use broadcast comm.
- WSN monitor objects,area
- WSN are more open to various security threats as unguided transmission medium is more open to security attacks than those of the guided transmission medium.
- Sybil Attack a node can pretend to be more than one node using the identities of other legitimate nodes
- Hello Flood
  - Attacker with a high radio transmission range and processing power sends HELLO packets to a number of sensor nodes.
- Worm Hole
  - Attacker records the packets (or bits) at one location in the network and tunnels those to another location
- Selective forwarding 
  - DoS
  - Neglect and Greed 
  - Blind Letter Attack

- packet sniffinbg happens over the network
- prevent SQL => escape Queries

contains malicious code?
  - Cross site scripting , SQL
- Which malicious program cannot do anything until actions are taken to activate the file attached by the malware.
  - virus
- **PayLoad** is the part of malware such as worms or viruses which performs the malicious action; deleting data, sending spam or encrypting data
#5
- 1st Boot Sector virus = brain
- proxy server is used to hide malicious activity on network
