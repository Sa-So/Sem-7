# Descriptive Stats
- to summarize & describe datasets
- desc charecteristics of data
- if sample is normally distributed or not
- displayed through tables/charts/ freq. dist. and is gen. reported as a measure of central tendency.

## Central Tendency
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode

Mean and median can only be used for numerical data. 
The mode can be used with numerical and nominal data both.

## Statistical Dispersion
1. Range - gives us the understanding of how spread out the given data is
2. Variance - gives us the understanding of how the far the measurements are from
the mean.
3. Standard Deviation - √var - gives us the measurement of how far the data deviate from mean.

## Bell Curve
- Graph of normal dist. of a variable
1. Skewness - measure of asymmetry of a dist. of a variable about its mean.
2. Kurtosis - measure of "tailedness" of a dist. of a variable . It gives us understanding of how closely the data is spread out.

# Common char. used in desc. stats.
## Center 
- middle of data (3Ms are used as measures)
The disadvantage of using Mode is that there may be more than one mode.

## Spread 
- how data is dispersed 
- Range / IQR / Standard Deviation / Variance are the most commonly used as measures.
1. Range = Max – Min
2. Inter Quartile Range (IQR) = Q3 – Q1
3. Standard Deviation (σ) = √(∑(x-μ)2 / n)
4. Variance = σ2

## Shape
1. Symmetric – the part of the distribution that is on the left side of the median is same as the part of the distribution that is on the right side of the median
2. Left skewed – the left tail is longer than the right side
3. Right skewed – the right tail is longer than the left side

## Outlier 
– An outlier is an abnormal value
1. Keep the outlier based on judgement
2. Remove the outlier based on judgement
