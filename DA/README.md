# Descriptive Stats
- to summarize & describe datasets
- desc charecteristics of data
- if sample is normally distributed or not
- displayed through tables/charts/ freq. dist. and is gen. reported as a measure of central tendency.

## Central Tendency
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode

Mean and median can only be used for numerical data. 
The mode can be used with numerical and nominal data both.

## Statistical Dispersion
1. Range - gives us the understanding of how spread out the given data is
2. Variance - gives us the understanding of how the far the measurements are from
the mean.
3. Standard Deviation - √var - gives us the measurement of how far the data deviate from mean.

## Bell Curve
- Graph of normal dist. of a variable
1. Skewness - measure of asymmetry of a dist. of a variable about its mean.
2. Kurtosis - measure of "tailedness" of a dist. of a variable . It gives us understanding of how closely the data is spread out.

# Common char. used in desc. stats.
## Center 
- middle of data (3Ms are used as measures)
The disadvantage of using Mode is that there may be more than one mode.

## Spread 
- how data is dispersed 
- Range / IQR / Standard Deviation / Variance are the most commonly used as measures.
1. Range = Max – Min
2. Inter Quartile Range (IQR) = Q3 – Q1
3. Standard Deviation (σ) = √(∑(x-μ)2 / n)
4. Variance = σ2

## Shape
1. Symmetric – the part of the distribution that is on the left side of the median is same as the part of the distribution that is on the right side of the median
2. Left skewed – the left tail is longer than the right side
3. Right skewed – the right tail is longer than the left side

## Outlier 
– An outlier is an abnormal value
1. Keep the outlier based on judgement
2. Remove the outlier based on judgement

# Probability Distributions Inferential Statistics through hypothesis tests

In Inferential statistics, we make an inference from a sample about the population. The main aim of inferential statistics is to draw some conclusions from the sample and generalise them for the population data

## Advantages of Inferential Stats.
- Making conclusions from a sample about the population
- To conclude if a sample selected is statistically significant to the whole
population or not
- Comparing two models to find which one is more statistically significant as compared to the other.
- In feature selection, whether adding or removing a variable helps in improving the model or not.

## Probability
 It is a measure of the chance of occurrence of a phenomenon. We will now discuss some terms which are very important in probability:
* Random Experiment:Random experiment or statistical experiment is an experiment in which all the possible outcomes of the experiments are already known. The experiment can be repeated numerous times under identical or similar conditions.
* Sample space: Sample space of a random experiment is the collection or set of all the possible outcomes of a random experiment.
* Event: A subset of sample space is called an event.
* Trial: Trial refers to a special type of experiment in which we have two types
of possible outcomes: success or failure with varying Success probability.
* Random Variable: A variable whose value is subject to variations due to randomness is called a random variable. A random variable is of two types: Discrete and Continuous variable. In a mathematical way, we can say that a
real-valued function X: S -> R is called a random variable where S is probability space and R is a set of real numbers.
