# Sem-7
- Let's hope next year is fun for y'all 
- If you still have an option to give objective exams this is the place to revise one day b4 all the important questions.
- We couldn't convince COE to let us give online exam at home but we chillin 
- Subjective Exam is good if you just want to pass (because a thing called grace marks exists)
- But if you wanna score better go for online exams (best decision of my life)
- objectiive mcq exams have no in betweens you know it or you don't so you never feel the time is less
- you can literally complete every exam in 5 mins.
- although you still have to wait 15 mins to leave, better enter the exam hall 10 mins late (jk don't do this)
